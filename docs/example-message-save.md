Based on my analysis of the current kickstart.nvim repository (fetched from GitHub) and your local config in ~/.config/nvim/init.lua, here's a comparison of the default plugins and configurations. I'll focus on key changes in the base plugins that kickstart ships with, as those are the "defaults" you mentioned wanting to track. This will help you decide if you should update your config to align with upstream changes.
Summary of Major Changes in Kickstart (Compared to Your Config)
Kickstart has evolved significantly since many users forked it. It now prioritizes modern, lightweight plugins and has streamlined its LSP/completion setup. Your config includes many additional plugins (e.g., Harpoon, Neo-tree, DAP), which are customizations beyond the base kickstart. The core differences are in completion (switched to Blink), LSP tooling (Mason updates), and indentation detection.
Plugin Differences
Here's a side-by-side of the default plugins in kickstart vs. your config. I've noted additions, removals, and replacements.
| Plugin/Category | Kickstart (Current) | Your Config | Notes/Recommendation |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Indent Detection | NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim (new) | tpope/vim-sleuth | Kickstart replaced vim-sleuth with guess-indent for better auto-detection. If you're happy with vim-sleuth, no need to change; guess-indent is more modern but similar. |
| Completion | saghen/blink.cmp (primary, with LuaSnip) | hrsh7th/nvim-cmp (old) + saghen/blink.cmp (you have both!) | Kickstart fully switched to Blink.cmp as the default (faster, simpler than nvim-cmp). You have both installed—consider removing nvim-cmp to avoid conflicts and match kickstart. Blink is now the recommended choice. |
| LSP Tooling | mason-org/mason.nvim (new org) + mason-org/mason-lspconfig | williamboman/mason.nvim + williamboman/mason-lspconfig | Kickstart updated to the new mason-org namespace (the original maintainer moved). Your config uses the old williamboman—update to avoid deprecation warnings. |
| Snippet Engine | LuaSnip (built into Blink) | LuaSnip + nvim-cmp setup | No major change, but integrated tighter with Blink in kickstart. |
| Formatting | stevearc/conform.nvim | stevearc/conform.nvim | Same plugin, but config differs (see below). |
| Statusline | Mini.statusline | Mini.statusline | Same. |
| Treesitter | nvim-treesitter | nvim-treesitter | Same, but kickstart added diff to ensure_installed. |
| Gitsigns | lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim | lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim | Same. |
| Which-Key | folke/which-key.nvim | folke/which-key.nvim | Same, but spec groups updated (e.g., kickstart uses <leader>s for search, you have more groups). |
| Colorscheme | folke/tokyonight.nvim | folke/tokyonight.nvim | Same. |
| Todo Comments | folke/todo-comments.nvim | folke/todo-comments.nvim | Same. |
| Mini Plugins | echasnovski/mini.nvim (ai, surround, statusline) | echasnovski/mini.nvim (same) | Same. |
| Lazydev | folke/lazydev.nvim | folke/lazydev.nvim | Same. |
| Telescope | nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim with deps | nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim with deps | Same. |
| New in Kickstart | - | (Your extras: Harpoon, Neo-tree, UFO, Autopairs, Indent-blankline, Lint, DAP) | Kickstart removed these from defaults to stay minimal. Keep them if you use them. |
Plugins You Have That Kickstart Removed as Defaults:
- Harpoon, Neo-tree, nvim-ufo, nvim-autopairs, indent-blankline, nvim-lint, nvim-dap: These were in older kickstart versions but stripped out for simplicity. Kickstart now focuses on core LSP/completion without extras.
Configuration Differences
- LSP Keymaps: Kickstart updated to more mnemonic keys (e.g., grn for rename, gra for code action) instead of your gd, gr, etc. It's more consistent with LSP conventions.
- Conform (Formatting): Your config uses lsp_fallback = not disable_filetypes[ft], while kickstart uses lsp_format = 'fallback' and lsp_format = 'fallback' in format_on_save. Kickstart's is simpler and more reliable.
- Blink.cmp: Kickstart has detailed opts for keymap presets, appearance, and fuzzy matching. Your config has Blink but less config—kickstart's is more polished.
- Mason: Kickstart sets automatic_installation = false and ensures tools via mason-tool-installer. Your config is similar but uses the old namespace.
- Options: Kickstart added confirm = true for unsaved buffers, and scrolloff = 10. You have similar but not these exact tweaks.
- Autocommands: Kickstart improved LSP attach/detach with better client method checks for Neovim 0.11 compatibility.
Recommendations
1. Update to Match Kickstart for Stability: Switch to mason-org/mason*, replace williamboman versions. Remove nvim-cmp and rely solely on Blink (it's better). Update conform opts to kickstart's for consistency.
2. Keep Your Extras: Plugins like Harpoon and Neo-tree aren't in kickstart anymore, but they're useful—retain them.
3. Test Before Merging: Kickstart's LSP keymaps are better; consider adopting them to align.
4. No Urgent Changes: If your config works, you don't need to update. But for future-proofing (e.g., Blink is faster), it's worth it.
5. Potential Issues: Having both nvim-cmp and Blink could cause conflicts—remove nvim-cmp.
If you'd like me to prepare a plan to update your config (e.g., edit init.lua to match kickstart's changes while preserving your additions), or focus on specific plugins, let me know!
